## CMS that lets you create draggable and resizable objets written in Vue (Vuex, Nuxt.js)

This version is only a demo with no backend. This project has a fully functional backend written in PHP Laravel, which can be seen in the master branch

https://martin-karsten.github.io/project_creator/200.html.

Nuxt.JS is causing some routing issues. If you click the link and get an error message, click go to home page.

This project is a side project and is still in alpha. Therefore is still has bugs that i have to fix. If you are interesting in how i built this project, go to the about section after clicking the link.
